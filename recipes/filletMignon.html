            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>This is the best filet mignon recipe for an elegant dinner for two. Red wine and balsamic vinegar make a wonderfully rich sauce to serve with the steak. Delicious with steamed asparagus and baby red potatoes.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Steaks: You'll need two filet mignon steaks for this restaurant-worthy recipe.</li>
                <li>Seasonings: This filet mignon is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Balsamic vinegar: Of course, you'll need balsamic vinegar. It's the star of the show!</li>
                <li>Wine: Choose a dry red wine, such as cabernet sauvignon.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Season the steaks: Sprinkle the filet mignon steaks with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Sear the steaks: Sear the steaks in a very hot pan until they're browned on both sides.</li>
                <li>Make the sauce: Reduce the heat to medium-low, then add the vinegar and wine. Cover and cook for about four minutes. Flip the steaks, baste with the sauce, and continue cooking for about four more minutes.</li>
                <li>Serve the steaks: Place the steaks on two warmed plates. Spoon the sauce over the meat and serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
